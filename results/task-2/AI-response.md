I'll analyze the documentation example and then create detailed documentation for the NotificationService. Let me start by examining the example structure and then create the documentation.

Read file: tasks/task-2.documentationExample.md
Now let me analyze the NotificationService code to understand its structure and functionality:

Read file: tasks/task-2.cs
Now I'll create the detailed documentation for the NotificationService following the structure and format of the example:

Perfect! I've created comprehensive documentation for the NotificationService following the structure and format of the provided example. Let me explain the step-by-step analysis I performed:

## Analysis of the Documentation Example Structure

### 1. **YAML Front Matter**
- Contains metadata: title, version, and date
- Provides essential document information at the top

### 2. **Overview Section**
- Brief description of what the service does
- High-level explanation of functionality and purpose

### 3. **API Reference Table**
- Structured table with Method, Description, and Return Type columns
- Clear, concise descriptions of each method
- Consistent formatting with backticks for method signatures

### 4. **Examples Section**
- **C# Usage**: Practical code examples showing how to use each method
- **Dependency Injection Setup**: Configuration examples for DI container
- **Configuration Example**: JSON configuration structure
- Multiple code blocks with appropriate language tags (`csharp`, `json`)

### 5. **Error Codes Table**
- Systematic listing of all possible error codes
- Clear descriptions of what each error means

### 6. **Additional Sections**
- **Dependencies**: Required packages and external services
- **Models**: Code examples of the data structures used
- **Notes**: Important implementation details and best practices

## Key Documentation Principles Applied

1. **Consistency**: Followed the exact same structure and formatting as the example
2. **Completeness**: Covered all methods, error codes, and configuration options
3. **Practical Examples**: Provided real-world usage scenarios
4. **Technical Accuracy**: Based on actual code analysis
5. **User-Friendly**: Clear explanations and step-by-step setup instructions

The documentation I created for the NotificationService includes all the essential information a developer would need to understand, configure, and use the service effectively, following the same professional standards as the example documentation.
