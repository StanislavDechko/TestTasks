You are a senior .NET Software Engineer with extensive experience in unit testing.
Write a thorough unit tests suite using xUnit to achieve 100% coverage. You can use ShippingServiceTests as an example.
Follow next rules:
1. The name of your test should consist of three parts:
Name of the method being tested
Scenario under which the method is being tested
Expected behavior when the scenario is invoked
2. Use AAA pattern
3. Prefer using test cases to creating new test methods
4. Each possible condition must be covered (for example isMember = true/false). Cover edge cases.

Explain how will you achieve the result step by step. Then start implementation.

put the result in OrderServiceTests.cs
